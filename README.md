**Final Project** based on Redis (NoSql Key-value) database. <br>
**Aim:** Following the launch of GPT-3, there's been a surge in AI models from companies like Facebook, Google, and Nvidia, with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 leading the industry. However, issues like hallucinations persist across models, prompting us to develop an app to verify the safety and accuracy of AI outputs, utilizing two models for added reliability.

Trying to deploy the website using aws, but have to figure out the backend deployment first using flask + redis.
